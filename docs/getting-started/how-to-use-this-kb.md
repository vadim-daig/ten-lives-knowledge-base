# How to use this knowledge base

## For volunteers (read-only)
- Use the homepage as the table of contents.
- If something is unclear or wrong, report it to the core team (or open a GitHub Issue if enabled).

## For editors
- Keep pages short.
- Prefer linking over duplicating info.
- If the structure changes, update `/docs/index.md` first.
