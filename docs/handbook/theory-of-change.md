# Theory of change (public framing)

Ten Lives describes multiple layers:

## Level 1 — Regenerative festival
A seven-day festival model where people do hands-on restoration in the morning and attend workshops/talks/music later. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Level 2 — Beyond the festival
The site describes four connected outcomes:
- Festival experience (applied learning + celebration)
- Community strengthening
- Awareness & education (“learn by doing”)
- Research (work with universities/communities; test practices; gather data) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Level 3 — Systemic regeneration focus (water cycles)
Ten Lives explains “digging holes (bunds) and strategically placing rocks” to slow runoff, increase infiltration, recharge aquifers, and support vegetation + soil recovery. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
